# Particle-System-Assignment
An assignment for advanced graphics programming to create a particle system. A data driven design allowing for creation of new particle effects and emitters without additional coding. All particle system and shader code created by Ethan Penney. Wolf engine and third party resources not created by me. Free assets taken from Poliigon.com

This repo stores the bulk of the main code but does not include the build folder, wolf engine, or any third party resources. Thus, it cannot be run. Examples and images can be found on my website: eppenney@github.io
